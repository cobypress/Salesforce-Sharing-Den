# Salesforce Sharing Den
Where I share all things Salesforce which I think are useful enough to share with the world!

## I have tried to create a decent folder structure, but feel free to let me know if u think its whack, ill try sort it out.
At the minute the Repository is just... Everything I share haha, I manually upload these, which I know isnt ideal.

I will probably sort it all out at some point, for now, this will do!

If you do need help finding anything, please let me know! Ill be happy to try help you with anything Salesforce Related

### Would also love some ideas for things to build! Always looking for ideas to be creative!

Take it easy!
