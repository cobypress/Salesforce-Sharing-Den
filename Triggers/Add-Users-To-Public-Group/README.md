# Automatically add users to a public group when they are created
You can easily filter this down, say for users who are active and are under a certain profile. Say for example you could have three profiles that should automatically be added to three different corresponding public groups, you could just create three of these.

Im also sure if you are a decent dev you could do that under one trigger, but I just dont know how yet. One day.
