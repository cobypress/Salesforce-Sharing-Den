# HOW TO NOTIFY USERS WHO DO NOT HAVE A PROFILE PICTURE
Not going to lie, this is not the best flow I have ever created. Not even close. There is a bit of redneckery that occured, and as its the first time ive used the flow action Notification, I found it pretty hard, as it has to use a collection variable- fuck that!

### FYI
If you do end up downloading this package, make sure you replace the hard-coded values. I know, Ugh, hard coded values. Unfortunately in this event I had to use them, becuase there is a custom notification in there. Oh yeah, and you will need to build a Custom Notification, not hard to do.

Take it easy!
