# HOW TO AUTOMATICALLY CREATE AND DELETE CAMPAIGN MEMBERS FROM A CHECKBOX
Here I answer a question on the trailblazer community on how to not only create a campaign member, but also delete it when the checkbox is unticked. Yeah I use a hardcoded value- try not to cry about it! I know ill be sleeping sound tonight knowing I used it.

In all seriousness though, here is an instance where if you are using a top level campaign, that isnt going to be changed often, I might reccomend hardcoding the CampaignId. But usually, as im sure you're aware, do not bother hard coding, put in that extra effort to make it dynamic!
